**Diffblue Cover** is an automated unit test-writing tool. It analyses your existing Java application and writes unit tests that reflect the current behavior, increasing test coverage and helping you find regressions in future code changes. Cover automatically maintains the tests by updating them when your code changes. Cover supports standard Java 8 & 11, Spring and Spring Boot.

In this scenario you will use Diffblue Cover 3.0 to automatically generate 94% unit test coverage for the sample Spring application, Spring-Petclinic.
